Hello! I'm Thomas, an audio engineer based in London, UK. I do everything from music production, stereo and immersive mixing/mastering, live sound engineering and event production work, and sound design and mixing for film.

This is my personal website, to host my portfolio, blog, and any other projects I'm working on.
