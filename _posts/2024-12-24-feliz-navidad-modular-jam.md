excuse the vertical filming, i literally threw this together this morning in the space of like 45 minutes. 

wish i had more MIDI kit, would have loved to get the neutron involved for the lead synth line, but instead i’m using the polyend tracker for both drums + synth as i don’t have the kit to daisy chain MIDI

apologies for cat screaming in background, he’s literally starving to death as he hasn’t been fed in a few hours…

merry christmas!
