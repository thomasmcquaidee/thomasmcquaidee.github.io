If you're reading this - we're back online! I've gone through, and updated / fixed / tweaked pretty much the entirety of this website. The blog still works, I've yet to make something that let's me publish straight from Obsidian to here, but I can do all my writing here and copy it over okay. 

The portfolio system is in place, I fill out information in a .yml file, and Jekyll will automatically format and display it. There's some tweaks I want to make to the look of the portfolio page, but all the code and information is working great so I'm happy to leave it how it is for a while.

I've tweaked a theme from iOS developer [Hiroki Nagasawa](https://pixyzehn.com/). I really love how dead simple his Jekyll site was, so I've taken a lot of inspiration for the foundation of mine. 

There's still a couple bits to edit and fix, but for an evening project (I did all of this last night), I'm pretty happy with how it's going!
