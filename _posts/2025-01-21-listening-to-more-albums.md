I've been making an effort to listen to more albums as full, cohesive bodies of work. It seems silly, especially considering my line of work, but I sometimes find it quite difficult to just sit a listen to a full album without getting distracted or bored. I love the idea of an album being a work of art that should be enjoyed as an album, rather than a collection of songs, so to change that I've been making more time to sit and listen, and I'll be updating this post with every album I listen to in 2025!
