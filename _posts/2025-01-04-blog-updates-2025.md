I'm writing this before I start my big blog update of the year. I find myself wanting to use my website more, but there's a few things about it that bug me, so I'm writing up a list of features that I want, so I can go through one-by-one and make sure I fix everything. 

This website needs to:
- Run on GitHub Pages. It's a static site, so I'm perfectly happy to stick it there, so I don't have to deal with web hosting.
- Have a nice theme. The one I'm currently using is quite nice, but I 100% stole it from somewhere and that doesn't quite sit right with me. I think I'll try something dead simple, and tweak it as needed.
- Allow me to write my blog posts in Obsidian (my note-taking app of choice), and then publish them to the site. I haven't quite figured out how I'm going to accomplish this, but it'd be super cool if I can write and publish from my phone too...
- Have a proper portfolio. I've got a spreadsheet detailing nearly every audio project I've ever worked on, I need to find a way to showcase the projects that I'm most proud of!
