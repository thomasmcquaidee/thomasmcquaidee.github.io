Two posts in two days?!?v Heavily inspired by a video I saw of someone who hooked up their Nintendo Wii to their pedalboard, I did the same with my old 3DS, and made an ambient thing with the Dire, Dire Docks theme from Super Mario 64.

3DS into the Strymon Flint, in stereo.

Left channel running through my girlfriends Reverberation Machine by Death by Audio, fantastic, gritty reverb pedal. 

Right channel going through my Memory Boy delay, using the Micro POG in send/return. Basically an analog version of Soundtoys Crystalliser!

Both channels into Pro Tools!
