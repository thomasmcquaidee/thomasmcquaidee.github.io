Yesterday I organised and hosted a panel at the University of West London, where I invited some incredibly talented up-and-coming audio engineers to talk about their experience in the industry, how they moved from graduates to professionals, and discussing their first roles in music.

I'd like to extend a massive thank you to the incredible panelists - their insight and advice was invaluable!

This was also my first time hosting an event like this. Public speaking has never been my strongest skill, but I had a great time discussing the London audio engineering scene with these amazingly talented people.
