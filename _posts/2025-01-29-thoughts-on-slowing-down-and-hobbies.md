As time goes on, I find myself looking for opportunities to slow down. I think it's partly the reason why I enjoy making pourover coffee or dialling in my espresso machine, it's way more work compared to an instant coffee, but it let's me slow down for 5 minutes a day and focus on a specific task. It also tastes way better which is a bonus, but surprisingly not my sole focus (sacrilegious to coffee people I know, but sometimes cheap, crappy drip coffee is exactly what you need...)

I'm currently trying to find a new hobby. I absolutely love what I do, and I'm incredibly proud of myself for being able to make music for a living. I did, however, encounter a funny situation whilst I was working as an assistant immersive mix engineer where I'd come home from work after working on music all day, and I'd find myself with nothing to do as the last thing I wanted to do is work on more music. By turning my hobby into a job, it means I can no longer do it as a hobby, at least not in the same way as before.

This year I made it my new year's resolution to take up reading again. I fell out of love with it whilst doing my English GCSE, which I really didn't enjoy, and I don't think I've read a book since. Armed with my mum's old Kindle, I've dived headfirst into the Dune series (currently just finishing book 2!). It was difficult at first, I actually thought I'd caught dyslexia because my brain just couldn't string the sentences together properly, but I'm finding myself enjoying it more and more!

I also really want to get into photography again this year. I used to have a camera, I had a Canon 1200D DSLR for a while, I ended up upgrading to a Song a6000 which I really loved, but ended up selling, probably to get more music gear. I really want to get back into it again, and I think a big reason for this is also to slow down and be a bit more mindful of what's going on around me. I think the added benefits of getting out of the house and having another creative outlet other than music also is really beneficial.
